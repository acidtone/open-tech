## Objectives
- Evaluate a project against accepted conventions of naming and directory structure.
- Refactor a project to conform to accepted conventions of naming and directory structure. 

## Directions
Dowload or clone a starter project into your workspace.
1. Identify asset files in the root directory that should be in dedicated folders:
    - CSS files should be in a `css` directory;
    - Javascript files should be in a `js` directory;
    - Images (`jpg`, `png`, `svg`, etc) should be in an `images` directory.
2. For each of the files you identified, create a dedicated directory in the project root.
3. Move each identified file into the appropriate directory.
4. Ensure the names of all files and directories conform to accepted naimg conventions.
5. Fix any links to these files that may have broken when you moved the files. The project should operate just as it did before you moved the files.
